## 📌 What is a Petroleum System?
A **petroleum system** consists of all geologic elements and processes required to generate, migrate, accumulate, and preserve hydrocarbons (oil and gas). Key components:
- **Source rock**
- **Reservoir rock**
- **Seal rock**
- **Trap structure**
- **Timing of processes**

## 📊 What is a Petroleum System Event Chart?

A **Petroleum System Event Chart** (PSEC) visually summarizes when and how key geological events occurred in a basin. It helps assess whether a petroleum system is working or failed.

## 🧩 Chart Components

### ⏱️ 1. Time Axis
- Runs from **~150 Ma to Present** (millions of years ago).
- Helps correlate geological events across time.

### 🌍 2. Geological Periods
- Shows stages like **Jurassic**, **Cretaceous**, and **Paleogene**.
- Helps align events with global geologic history.

## 🔄 3. Key Events in Petroleum System

| Event            | Description |
|------------------|-------------|
| **Deposition**    | Formation of source rock by sediment accumulation. |
| **Maturation**    | Transformation of organic material into hydrocarbons due to burial and heat. |
| **Migration**     | Movement of oil and gas from source to reservoir. |
| **Trap Formation**| Development of structural/stratigraphic traps. |
| **Preservation**  | Hydrocarbons remain trapped without leakage. |

Each event is shown as a horizontal bar spanning the time it occurred.

## ⭐ 4. Critical Moment
- Marked by a **star** on the chart.
- Defined as the point in time when all necessary elements (mature source, migration, and trap) coincided to allow hydrocarbon accumulation.

⏳ **If migration occurs before trap formation, hydrocarbons may be lost!**

---

## 🎯 Importance of the Chart
- ✅ Evaluate if a petroleum system is viable.
- ✅ Identify when traps and source matured.
- ✅ Reduce exploration risk.
- ✅ Guide drilling decisions.

---

## 🛑 Common Mistakes to Avoid
- Don’t let **trap formation occur after migration**—this causes loss.
- Ensure spelling and clarity (correct typos like “Migragion” → “Migration”).

## ✅ Summary Table

| Element         | Role in System                  |
|----------------|----------------------------------|
| Source Rock     | Origin of hydrocarbons          |
| Maturation      | Converts organic matter         |
| Migration       | Moves hydrocarbons              |
| Trap Formation  | Creates containment structure   |
| Preservation    | Keeps oil/gas in place          |
| Critical Moment | When everything came together   |
